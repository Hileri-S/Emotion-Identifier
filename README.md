# Emotion-Identifier
The model uses Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Emotion Detector/Identifier and Speech Output. The model has been trained with the learning dataset, and now will be able to give the output correctly on the UI when the app is being used. 

 I made this project to identify emotions of people and return it to them. This can even be used by people who are disabled since it has a voice output and a text output. The Emotion Detector's objective is to detect emotions and you can even use it to find if anyone is lying. The person's emotions will be fear if he is lying. AI powered Emotion Detector can contribute to the educational field by reading children's emotions as they study and improve the learning system as well. It can be used to monitor studentsâ€™ engagement with their homework. It can also be used in situations with much higher stakes, such as in hiring, by airport security to flag faces as revealing deception or fear.

More information on the topic will be given by this video, where I have explained it in detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta9Aqf3oZWw
